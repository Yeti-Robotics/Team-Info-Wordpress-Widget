#The YETI Team Info WordPress Widget

###How to use
1. Go to [thebluealliance.com](https://www.thebluealliance.com/) and find the event page for the event you wish to display
2. The URL should say `www.thebluealliance.com/event/{the year}{the event key}`
3. Remember this event key, and head to `http://yetirobotics.org/Programmers/widget.php?teamNumber={your team number}&eventKey={the event key}`
4. If you see a full-screen-width version of the widget, great! You can now include this in anypage using an iframe
5. To use in wordpress specificlly, use a text widget and make sure this is the only thing in there:
```<iframe height=305px src="http://yetirobotics.org/Programmers/widget.php?teamNumber={your team number}&eventKey={the event key}"></iframe>```

If your event has not yet started, and your team has no ranking info, not seeing anything is normal, and we advise you display your latest event info until it begins
